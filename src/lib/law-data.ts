    topic: 'Grammar: Subject-Verb Agreement',
    category: 'English',
    content: `The verb in a sentence must agree with its subject in number (singular or plural).
- **Rule 1:** A singular subject takes a singular verb; a plural subject takes a plural verb. (e.g., The dog barks. The dogs bark.)
- **Rule 2:** Words like 'each', 'every', 'either', 'neither', 'everyone', 'everybody' are singular and require a singular verb. (e.g., Each of the students is smart.)
- **Rule 3:** When two subjects are joined by 'and', they typically require a plural verb. (e.g., The cat and the dog are friends.)
- **Rule 4:** When subjects are joined by 'or' or 'nor', the verb agrees with the subject nearer to it. (e.g., Neither the students nor the teacher is present.)
- **Rule 5:** Collective nouns (e.g., team, committee, family) can be singular or plural depending on whether they are treated as a single unit or as individuals. (e.g., The team is winning. The team are arguing among themselves.)`,

    1. All pens are pencils.
    2. All pencils are books.
  - **Conclusions:**
    I. All pens are books.
    II. All books are pens.
- **Solution:** Draw a small circle for 'Pens' inside a larger circle for 'Pencils'. Then draw the 'Pencils' circle inside an even larger circle for 'Books'. From the diagram, you can see that all Pens are indeed Books (Conclusion I follows). However, you cannot conclude that all Books are Pens (Conclusion II does not follow).`,

- **Solution:**
  - "The only daughter of my mother" is the woman herself.
  - So, "His mother is the woman herself."
