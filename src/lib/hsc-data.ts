            short: "An astrologer, running his business under a tamarind tree, encounters a stranger who challenges him. The stranger, Guru Nayak, is revealed to be a man the astrologer tried to kill years ago. The astrologer cleverly uses his knowledge of the past to convince Guru Nayak that his attacker is dead, thus saving his own life and finding relief from his guilt.",
            detailed: `In "An Astrologer's Day," a man who presents himself as an astrologer conducts his daily business in a bustling town square. He has no genuine knowledge of astrology but relies on shrewd guesswork, common sense, and psychological reading of his clients. His appearance—with sacred ash, vermilion, and a turban—lends him an air of mystical wisdom.

Late one evening, a skeptical man named Guru Nayak confronts him, bets a significant amount of money, and demands a substantial answer to a specific question about his past. The astrologer, initially hesitant, agrees. As they talk, the astrologer recognizes the man as the very person he had stabbed and left for dead in a drunken quarrel years ago, which was the reason he fled his village and adopted this new identity.

Using this secret knowledge, the astrologer "divines" the details of the attack: that the man was stabbed and left in a well to die. He tells Guru Nayak that his attacker died under a lorry months ago. He warns Guru Nayak to never travel southward again and to return home immediately to avoid another threat to his life.

Guru Nayak is astonished by the accuracy and leaves, satisfied and paying the astrologer. The astrologer returns home late and confesses to his wife that a great load is gone from him because he has learned that the man he thought he had killed is actually alive.`,

He is resourceful and uses his wits to make a living and, ultimately, to save himself from his past. He carries a heavy burden of guilt, which is lifted by the end of the story."

        theme: "The central theme revolves around fate, guilt, and the power of disguise. It explores how a single past event can shape a person's entire life. The story also touches on the theme of appearance versus reality, as the astrologer's entire persona is a fabrication to hide his true identity and escape his past. The climax brings a sense of poetic justice and relief, as the astrologer uses his deception to bring closure to both himself and his victim.",
