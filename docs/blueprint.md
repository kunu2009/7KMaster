# **App Name**: 7K Master Dashboard

## Core Features:

- Today Tab: Organize and display daily tasks with a focus on 'Today' view, showing time blocks, tasks, and completion status.
- Projects Tab: Track and display progress on various projects within the '7K Ecosystem', including status, last worked date, and next actions.

- Self & Space Tab: Track habits, environmental factors, and personal goals related to self-improvement and space organization.
- Progress Tab: Visualize progress with weekly graphs of time spent per app, skill progress, and streak tracking, along with an archive of completed tasks and a backup section for exporting data.
- Theme Toggle: Implement light/dark mode toggle for user preference and minimal UI design with card-based layouts and swipeable interfaces.
- Data Persistence: Enable local storage-based data persistence for offline accessibility, with options to export to JSON and a prominent '+ New Entry' button in each tab.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted teal (#45A0A2), inspired by the integration of technology (often associated with blue/cyan) and growth (often associated with green). The muted tone ensures it's calming and professional, rather than jarring. This color anchors on feelings of progress and forward motion.
- Background color: Very light, desaturated teal (#E0F4F4). This keeps a sense of the primary hue, while allowing content to stand out.
- Accent color: Muted purple (#8E72A0), provides a subtle but visible contrast for interactive elements and important highlights, sitting analogously to the left of teal on the color wheel.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern and clean interface suitable for dashboard clarity. 
- Use clean, geometric icons to represent different sections and actions, ensuring they are easily recognizable.
- Employ a card-based layout with big text and clear sections for easy navigation and readability on both desktop and mobile.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback on user interactions and enhance the overall user experience.
